## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Self-Hosting)

You need a Google Account to use Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.

### Step 1: Prepare Google Sheets

1.  Create a **New Google Sheet** and name it (e.g., "Student Fee Records").
2.  Rename the first sheet to `Student Registration`. The script will automatically populate the header row on the first run.

### Step 2: üîó Full Source Code

If you want to see the complete Apps Script code in a single file, click here:

  </a>
</p>

### Step 3: Deploy the Apps Script Backend

1.  In your Google Sheet, go to `Extensions` \> `Apps Script`.
2.  Paste the provided Google Apps Script code into the editor.
3.  Click **Save Project**.
4.  Click **Deploy** (top right) \> **New deployment**.
5.  Set the deployment type to **Web app**.
6.  Configure the settings:
      * **Execute as:** `Me` (your account).
      * **Who has access:** `Anyone`.
7.  Click **Deploy** and complete the necessary **authorization** steps (you'll need to grant permission for the script to manage your spreadsheets).
8.  **Crucially, copy the resulting Web app URL.** This is your unique backend API endpoint.

### Step 4: Connect the Frontend

1.  Open your `index.html` frontend file.
2.  Find the JavaScript variable for the API URL:
    ```javascript
    const SCRIPT_URL = ''; // <-- PASTE YOUR URL HERE
    ```
3.  Paste the **Web app URL** you copied in Step 2 between the single quotes.
4.  Save the `index.html` file.

The application is now fully linked\! You can host your `index.html` file on any service (like Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages, or a local server) to use the system.

## üôå Contribution

We welcome contributions\! If you have suggestions for new features, bug fixes, or improvements to the codebase, please:
